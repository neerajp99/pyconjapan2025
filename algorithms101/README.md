# Algorithms 101 - Creative Coding Examples

This folder contains various creative coding algorithms and visual patterns implemented in Python.

## Requirements

All scripts in this folder require the following dependencies:

- **py5** - Python implementation of Processing for creative coding
- **numpy** - For mathematical operations (used in fractal examples)
- **math** - Built-in Python math library
- **random** - Built-in Python random library
- **typing** - Built-in Python type hints (used in some examples)

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install py5 numpy
```

## Running the Examples

Each Python file is a standalone example that can be run directly:

```bash
python enhanced_fractals.py
python japanese_waves.py
python voronoi_textile.py
python perlin_noise_japanese.py
# ... and so on
```

## Examples Included

- **enhanced_fractals.py** - Interactive fractal renderer with multiple fractal types
- **japanese_waves.py** - Traditional Japanese wave patterns with organic textures
- **voronoi_textile.py** - Cellular Voronoi patterns for textile design
- **perlin_noise_japanese.py** - Japanese-inspired Perlin noise patterns
- **floral_sine_textile.py** - Floral patterns using sine wave mathematics
- **sine_wave_textile.py** - Basic sine wave textile patterns
- **enhanced_topography.py** - Organic topographical map generation
- **fractal.py** - Basic fractal implementations

## Note

These examples are designed for creative coding, data visualization, and algorithmic art. Each script opens an interactive window where you can see the generated patterns and often interact with them using mouse and keyboard controls.
